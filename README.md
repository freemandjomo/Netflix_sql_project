## SCHEMA OF THE TABLE :
```sql
-- advanced SQL Project -- NETFLIX 
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS netflix;
CREATE TABLE netflix
(
    show_id      VARCHAR(25),
    type         VARCHAR(10),
    title        VARCHAR(250),
    director     VARCHAR(550),
    casts        VARCHAR(1050),
    country      VARCHAR(550),
    date_added   VARCHAR(55),
    release_year INT,
    rating       VARCHAR(15),
    duration     VARCHAR(15),
    listed_in    VARCHAR(250),
    description  VARCHAR(550)
);
``` 
## 1. Count the number of Movies vs TV Shows
```sql 
  SELECT type,   
	    COUNT(*) 
	    FROM netflix 
	 GROUP BY 1
```
## 3. Find the most common rating for movies and TV shows

```sql 
   WITH RatingCounts AS (
    SELECT 
        type,
        rating,
        COUNT(*) AS rating_count
    FROM netflix
    GROUP BY type, rating
),
RankedRatings AS (
    SELECT 
        type,
        rating,
        rating_count,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY type ORDER BY rating_count DESC) AS rank
    FROM RatingCounts
)
SELECT 
    type,
    rating AS most_frequent_rating
FROM RankedRatings
WHERE rank = 1;
```
## 4. Find the top 5 countries with the most content on Netflix
```sql
    SELECT UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(country,',')) as countries, 
	  COUNT(*) as contents    
	  FROM  netflix
	  GROUP BY 1
	  ORDER BY contents DESC
	  LIMIT 5
 ```  
## 5. List all movies released in a specific year (e.g., 2020)
   ```sql
         SELECT * 
	     FROM netflix
	     WHERE type = 'Movie' and release_year = 2020
       ```
